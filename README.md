# GraphAlgo
This project contains graph algorithms that can help you to understand the basic of graph theory such as DFS (Depth-first search), BFS (Breadth-first search), Dijkstra's algorithm, Graph coloring and Adjacency matrix. Also in this repository , there a folder that contain the steps to manipulate this algorithms by grapics vues in C langage (by using CodeBlocks).
